# Dictionary-Application
Create Your Own Dictionary!

## How To Use

* It is quite simple to use the application. 

* When you've learned a new word in the language you want to improve,  
add its equivalent in one or two more languages(English and Turkish in this example).

* So that, you build your own dictionary and practice the words 
that you struggle to remember.

* To make a quick summary and stick the words better in your mind, use the "quiz" section where you are given 12 words and asked to write their Norwegian equivalents. 

* Delete or mark the the words as "Kelimeyi Öğrendim" to not face them again in the quiz part, if they are similar enough to you.

## Install
* You're needed to have [`jdk`](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) on your machine.
* Beside that, downloading the rar file is enough to use.
