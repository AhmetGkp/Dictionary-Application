Create Your Own Dictionary!

-I have made this application to 
help me improve my Norwegian. 
## How To Use
-It is quite simple to use that.

-When you've learned a new word in Norwegian, you 
add the word with its English and Turkish equivalent.

* Thus, you make your own dictionary and check words 
that you don't remember.

- If you think, you need to practice them you use the "quiz" part. 
So that you stick the words in your mind.

-Mark the words as "Kelimeyi Öğrendim" to not face with them 
at the quiz if it's enough similar to you. Or just delete them.
## Install
-You're needed to have `jdk` 
-Downloading the rar file is enough to use.
